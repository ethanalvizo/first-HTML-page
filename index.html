            <h3>What is biomedical engineering?</h3>
            <p>The field of biomedical engineering is multi-disciplinary as they not only have to understand the engineering principles but also how they apply to complex biological systems. As technology's role in the health industry grows, biomedical engineers are leading the charge in bridging the gap between medicine and technology to solve health-related issues.</p>
